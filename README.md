Thess code describe how Decision Tree working and their code .

Decision Tree : Decision tree is the most powerful and popular tool for classification and prediction. A Decision tree is a flowchart like tree structure, where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label. 

Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.

It  is called a decision tree because, similar to a tree, it starts with the root node, which expands on further branches and constructs a tree-like structure.

Here there are two files that contain ccodes and explanation are .ipynb file and .py file.

And one file are .pdf for reading pupose .
